# FishingSimulator2023
CS347 (Game Design &amp; Programming) Final Project, made by Ben Bruzewski

This game is a collectathon style fishing game where the objective is to catch all of the different kinds of fish.
- When you go to catch a fish, a minigame will load that you must complete to catch the fish.
- These minigames vary in difficulty depending on the fish you have on the line
- In this build, there are 3 minigames and 8 fish spanning across 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- The game environment was designed in 3D, but the minigames take place in 2D space.
